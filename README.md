# Shadow Brokers / Equation Group analysis

## Overview

The Shadow Brokers Equation Group dump consists of a number of partial dumps.

I am currently looking at the list of compromised hosts (Intonation/Pitchimpair), which includes
getting very distracted with all the really cool tricks of the trade included in the files.
I'm working from **x0rz** repositories (https://github.com/x0rz/) as well as the initial release on Mega.
Just to start somewhere, I was using alist online which describes some of the implants and what they supposedly do.
As I dive deeper (and as others also spend way too much time spelunking) I hope we get more clarity on this.

|Tool name      |functionality           |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
|DEWDROP        |Command and Control     |
|INCISION       |Rootkit/Backdoor linux  |
|INTONATION     |?                       |
|JACKLADDER     |?                       |
|ORANGUTAN      |?                       |
|PATCHICILLIN   |?                       |
|RETICULUM      |?                        |
|SIDETRACK      |implant for PITCHIMPAIR 1)|
|STOICSURGEON   |Rootkit/Backdoor        |

## Intonation Onesies

<img align="left" src="onesies.jpg">

The initial Shadow Brokers dump was called `trickortreat`. It contains two directories
`pitchimpair` and `intonation`. These in turn contain directories in the format `<hostname>__<ipaddress>`.
In each directory is/are file(s) containing parameters to be fed into different tools.
When I figure out exactly what is happening, I'll go into that further.
For instance, the `incision` example below seems to have been fed into `tn` to set up an INCISION
shell called `ish`.

*incision*:

```bash
INTONATION___bgl1dr1-a-fixed.sancharnet.in___61.1.128.17___20040323-141833() {
    ## INCISION Version:4.9.1 OS:sparc-sun-solaris2.8
    export TARG_AYT="36eb9564 129b94c7 695de5dc"
}
```

Both `intonation` and `pitchimpair` include a number of targets which have only one
implant. Being Dutch, opcwdns.opcw.nl (`195.193.177.150`) caught my eye.
OPCW is the **Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons**.
That would seem like a prime target for the NSA to have backdoor access to.
Which started me wondering: why only one (JACKLADDER) implant?

It is generally thought that the tools Shadow Brokers initially released, were meant for
what can be crudely described as "plumbing": a group gaining footholds in networks
which could be used (by others, or from different systems than the Shadow Brokers had
access to) to stage subsequent attacks.

This is my thesis: If access was (accidentally) gained to a high-value target, no further
"plumbing" was done and the access was leveraged for other activities (by others/from elsewhere?).
For this to be true, we would need to see a distinct difference between the "onesies" and
this systems with multiple implants.

To start, I looked at all the "*onesies*" in the `intonation` list, combining historical and current data
to determine what type of organizations where behind the hosts/IP addresses. For my theory to pan out,
these "*onesies*" would have to be prime targets.

Each host with multiple implants would also have to be a lesser-value target for my thesis to hold up.
I will be looking into the `intonation` list first, working from *onesies* to the multiple ones.

Rather large amounts of work still need to be done, but I'll share my findings as I go. Lets see where it
gets me.

Starting with the list of "onesies" as part of the `intonation` "pitch":

Working with hostnames/ IP addresses/ whois data/ (scholar.)google.com and archive.org was tricky, 
because most of the tools of the trade try to be current, not historical. In the end my endeavors resulted in the following list.

The most interesting part is that, except for the (for me) unclear one in Korea, all of them point to targets which I could reason are high-value to the NSA.
But `laleh.itrc.ac.ir` is actually running multiple implants (it seemed a onesie because of the trailing dot in a directory name). So that makes the theory somewhat shaky.

Lets start by working down from the systems with most implants. Although there are a number of targets with 7 (and one target, apparently incorrect 8) implants, they are all in `pitchimpair`. 

### Intonation targets with six(6) implants

 2. All files have the same INTONATION function(?) with the same timestamp for all implants per target
 3. All of them are from 2006

 - Looking at CVE databases only showed some xss and local exploits (https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-5/product_id-4721/SUN-Iplanet-Messaging-Server.html) 


For example:

http://mail.mail.sarai.net/pipermail/aaj-ke-naam_mail.sarai.net/2006-April/007106.html

But having no publicly known exploit didn't stop these people. They literally had a working exploit ready for most versions:

```bash

```

Starting as it does with "badBytes" the `iplanet.py` script is immediately recognisable as an exploit to anyone who has ever written one.

```python
1 import time
  2 import smtpUtils
  3 import systems
  4 import utils
  5
  6 class iplanet:
  7    badBytes = [0x0, 0xa, 0xd]
  8    nAttempts = 1
  9
 10    def buildBaseBuffer(self, imtaBase):
 11       filler = utils.buildBuffer(self.baseBufLen, self.badBytes)
 12       baseBuf = filler[0x0:]
 13       return baseBuf
 14
 15    def buildBounceBuffer(self):
 16       imtaBase = self.imtaBase
 17       baseBuf = self.buildBaseBuffer(imtaBase)
 18       l7 = (imtaBase + self.l7Imta) + self.l7Offset
 19       fp = imtaBase + self.fp
 20       filler = utils.buildBuffer(0x18, self.badBytes)
 21       bounceBuf = baseBuf \
 22                   + utils.stringifyAddr(l7) \
 23                   + filler \
 24                   + utils.stringifyAddr(fp) \
 25                   + utils.stringifyAddr(self.pc - 8)
 26       return bounceBuf
 27
```

It seems to be using smtp, so it very much seems like they had (or have) a way of gaining access to a ridiculously often used Enterprise Multi-Tier messaging platform... by sending an email.
And it probably paid off nicely for these guys to have this 0-day (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Communications_Messaging_Server):

>Oracle Communications Messaging Server is Oracle's messaging (email) server software.
>The software was obtained by Oracle as part of the company's acquisition of Sun in 2010.
>
>Oracle's Messaging Server could potentially be the most widely deployed commercial
>email server on the planet, with claims of 150 million mailboxes deployed worldwide
>(mostly by ISPs, telcos, universities, government, and cable TV broadband providers).
>History of development

>**with only feature enhancements and bug fixes.**

**Sic.**

I just shudder when I read that last sentence. I hope the guys at Oracle/that which was Sun are paying attention, because
if I look at the list of typical users, this would have been (is?) a very fruitful 0-day to have:

![Oracle Communications Messaging Server](ocm.png)

It will be interesting to find out which other targets might have been compromised this way.
Additionally of note is that I could not find `esna` nor something matching that acronym in any of the implant lists.
This could mean that the initial RCE/0-day of a target is not included in those lists, although "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence".


To be continued ...


## Notes

1) It doesn't seem like sidetrack was not used for pitchimpair:

```bash
‚††‚†µ ls -R intonation/ |grep -i sidetrack |wc -l
23
‚††‚†µ ls -R pitchimpair/ |grep -i sidetrack |wc -l
37
```


## Appendix A

Counting the implants per directory:

*count.sh*

```bash
find . -type d -print0 | while read -d '' -r dir; do
files=("$dir"/*)
printf "%5d files in directory %s\n" "${#files[@]}" "$dir"
done
```

## targets with one(1) (registered) implant

```bash
for dir in `bash count.sh | sort -n -r | grep '1 files' | awk '{print $5}'`; do echo -n "$dir: " && ls $dir;done
